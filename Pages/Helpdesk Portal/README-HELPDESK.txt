Pages we want here:

- Log new call
	Selected when the helpdesk receives a new call from an employee.
	They must be able to log all of the details about the problem into
	the PROBLEMS table.
	The CALL LOG table should be mostly generated automatically, but
	the helpdesk should note a "Call Reason".
	If multiple problems are listed in one call, the helpdesk should log
	these as multiple calls. Each call corresponds to one problem.
	Assigned Specialist, Date Solved and Solution Notes
	will have default values when the call is initially logged.
	
	Note: Possible "solved status" field, if solved is considered a non
	boolean
